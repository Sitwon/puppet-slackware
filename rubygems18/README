RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third party
libraries.

This is the ruby 1.8 version, it will require ruby18 package from
sid77.slackware.it.

NOTICE:
 While the rubygems installation will be managed with this SlackBuild,
 the gems that will get installed to --local 'system', will be existing 
 in '/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/' 
 You can 'uninstall' them with `gem18`, but otherwise they will remain
 if the rubygems package is removed.
