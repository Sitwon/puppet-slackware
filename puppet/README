Puppet is an enterprise systems management platform that standardizes the way
IT staff deploy and manage infrastructure in the enterprise and the cloud.
By automating the provisioning, patching, and configuration of operating
system and application components across infrastructure, Puppet enables IT
staff to master their infrastructure even as complexity grows.

The shift to cloud-based services has dramatically altered the IT landscape as
we know it. Enterprise infrastructure borders have expanded beyond the
firewall and now include hosted applications and infrastructure from Amazon
Web Services and other providers.
Puppet helps DevOps teams meet their common objectives, creating a seamless IT
infrastructure across departments, reducing cost and increasing productivity.

This package will install a bare puppet setup: to have it working reliably,
remember to setup an appropriate /etc/puppet/puppet.conf and to populate both
/etc/puppet/manifests and /etc/puppet/modules. Some sample files generated
with the --genconfig option are shipped within /etc/puppet folder.

Default server type for puppet master is webrick, support for mongrel is
present but in order to use it you have to install the mongrel ruby library
using rubygems18: "gem18 install mongrel"

This package requires facter and ruby18. An optional dependency is rubygems18,
in case you want to install the mongrel gem. All of these SlackBuilds are
available from sid77.slackware.it as well.
